To bring your application to life using Next.js with Supabase, here's a step-by-step approach:

### 1. **Set Up Supabase and Database Schema**
   - **Sign up for Supabase**: Set up your project and configure your database.
   - **Create Tables**: Define the required tables in Supabase (`profiles`, `orders`, `products`, `commissions`, etc.) and set up foreign key relationships.
   - **Enable Supabase Auth**: Use Supabase’s built-in user authentication system to manage sign-ups and log-ins. This will handle the `auth.users` table.

### 2. **Integrate Supabase into Next.js**
   - **Install Supabase SDK**: Install the Supabase client in your Next.js app.
   - **Client Setup**: Configure Supabase in your Next.js app by initializing it in the `lib` folder.
   - **User Authentication**: Implement sign-up and login pages using Supabase's auth methods.
   - **Generate Coupon Code**: After user sign-up, generate the coupon code by combining the first name, last name, and random digits, ensuring uniqueness by checking existing codes in the database.
   
### 3. **User Profile Management**
   - **Create Profile Pages**: After user registration, redirect users to a profile page where they can view their details (name, coupon code, etc.).
   - **Store Profile Data**: Store the user's additional profile data in the `profiles` table when they sign up or update their details.

### 4. **Product Management**
   - **Product List and Detail Pages**: Fetch and display products from the `products` table using Supabase queries. Create a product catalog page and individual product detail pages.
   - **Add to Cart**: Implement a shopping cart to allow users to select products, which will be stored temporarily on the client (e.g., in a React state or context).
   
### 5. **Checkout Process**
   - **Apply Coupon Code**: During checkout, allow users to apply a coupon code. Fetch the discount from the `profiles` table and apply it to the total amount.
   - **Track Coupon Issuer**: When a coupon is used, log the original issuer in the `orders` table.

### 6. **Commission System**
   - **Track Commissions**: When a coupon is applied, update the `commissions` table to log the commission for the coupon issuer.
   - **Payment of Commissions**: You can create a dashboard for users to track their commissions, showing the earned amounts based on orders where their coupon was used.

### 7. **Orders and Payment**
   - **Order Management**: After checkout, store the order details in the `orders` and `order_items` tables, logging the products, total amount, discount, and coupon used.
   - **Payments Integration**: Use Stripe or another payment gateway to handle payments. Once payment is successful, create the order in the database.

### 8. **User Dashboards**
   - **Order History**: Create an order history page where users can view their past purchases.
   - **Affiliate Dashboard**: Build a dashboard for users to track the usage of their coupon and the commissions they’ve earned.

### 9. **Admin Panel**
   - **Product Management**: Create an admin panel for managing the product catalog (add, update, delete products).
   - **Commission Payouts**: Track unpaid commissions and mark them as paid when commissions are distributed.

### 10. **Deploy on Vercel**
   - **Deploy**: Once your app is fully functional, deploy it on Vercel, which integrates well with Next.js.
   - **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data like Supabase keys, Stripe API keys, etc., as environment variables in Vercel.

This setup brings together Supabase for the backend (authentication, database), Next.js for the frontend (server-side rendering, React components), and Stripe (or another payment gateway) to complete the e-commerce functionality with user profiles, product management, and a commission system.
