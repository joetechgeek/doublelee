Before starting, here are key things to keep in mind:

1. **Supabase Setup**: Make sure your database schema is well-defined, with all necessary tables (`profiles`, `orders`, `products`, `commissions`, etc.). Ensure Supabase authentication is working and integrated.

2. **State Management**: Plan how you'll manage global states like cart items and user sessions, either with React Context, Redux, or another state management tool.
//let us use react context for this

3. **Coupon Code Logic**: Ensure you have a clear approach for generating unique coupon codes and applying them at checkout (validate and calculate discounts).

4. **Commissions Tracking**: Plan how to track commission payouts and display the earnings for users who issued coupon codes.

5. **Payment Integration**: Choose a payment provider (e.g., Stripe). Understand how you'll handle webhooks for successful payments, applying discounts, and recording orders.
//let us use stripe for this

6. **Routing**: Make use of Next.js routing for creating pages like product listings, profile, and dashboard. Decide if you want to use the new App Router or stick with the Pages Router.

7. **Styling**: Plan your styling approach. Tailwind CSS is great for fast and responsive designs, but ensure you organize utility classes efficiently.
//let us use tailwind for this

8. **Environment Variables**: Safeguard your API keys and other sensitive data using `.env.local`.
//we dont have to worry about this because we are using vercel to define the environment variables

9. **Testing and Debugging**: Be prepared to test your API calls, coupon validation, and commission tracking thoroughly.

Getting these things clear will save you time when you start coding.
