To ensure that your app functions correctly based on the logic you've described (user authentication, profile management, coupon system, order tracking, commission payouts, and discounts), hereâ€™s the full list of essential tables you need to create in Supabase, along with the built-in `auth.users` table Supabase provides for authentication.

### 1. **Built-in Table: `auth.users`**
- **Purpose**: This is the default table provided by Supabase to store user authentication data such as email and password.
- **Fields**:
  - `id`: Unique user identifier (Primary key, used as a foreign key in other tables).
  - `email`: The user's email address (unique).

---

### 2. **Table: `profiles` (User Profile Information)**
- **Purpose**: Store additional user details, such as first name, last name, phone number, and the generated unique coupon code.
- **Fields**:
  - `id`: Primary key, foreign key referencing `auth.users.id`.
  - `first_name`: The user's first name.
  - `last_name`: The user's last name.
  - `email`: The user's email address (optional, can reference `auth.users.email`).
  - `phone_number`: The user's phone number.
  - `coupon_code`: A unique, system-generated coupon code (e.g., `JOHNDOE123`).
  - **Why necessary**: This table ensures that you have the user details and coupon code information that are essential for your business logic.

#### SQL:
```sql
create table profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade primary key,
  first_name text not null,
  last_name text not null,
  email text unique,
  phone_number text,
  coupon_code text unique not null
);
```

### 3. **Table: `orders` (Order Tracking)**
- **Purpose**: Store information about user orders, including coupon usage and discounts.
- **Fields**:
  - `id`: Primary key, unique identifier for each order.
  - `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the buyer (from `profiles.id`).
  - `total_amount`: The total amount for the order.
  - `discount_applied`: Numeric value representing the discount applied (10% if a coupon is used).
  - `coupon_code`: Foreign key referencing the coupon used (from `profiles.coupon_code`).
  - `issued_by`: Foreign key referencing the user who issued the coupon (from `profiles.id`).
  - `commission_paid`: Boolean flag to track whether the commission has been paid to the coupon issuer.
  - **Why necessary**: Tracks user purchases, applied coupons, and the relationships between buyers and coupon issuers.

#### SQL:
```sql
create table orders (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references profiles(id),
  total_amount numeric not null,
  discount_applied numeric default 0, -- 10% discount if coupon applied
  coupon_code text references profiles(coupon_code),
  issued_by uuid references profiles(id), -- the original coupon issuer
  commission_paid boolean default false
);
```

### 4. **Table: `commissions` (Commission Payout Tracking)**
- **Purpose**: Track commissions earned by users who issued a coupon used during checkout.
- **Fields**:
  - `id`: Primary key, unique identifier for each commission entry.
  - `issuer_id`: Foreign key referencing the user who issued the coupon (from `profiles.id`).
  - `order_id`: Foreign key referencing the related order (from `orders.id`).
  - `commission_amount`: The commission earned (10% of the total order).
  - `paid`: Boolean flag indicating whether the commission has been paid.
  - **Why necessary**: Ensures commissions are tracked and paid correctly to users who issued coupons.

#### SQL:
```sql
create table commissions (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  issuer_id uuid references profiles(id),
  order_id bigint references orders(id),
  commission_amount numeric not null,
  paid boolean default false
);
```

### 5. **Table: `products` (Product Catalog)**
- **Purpose**: Store product information, including price, which is essential for order creation.
- **Fields**:
  - `id`: Primary key, unique identifier for each product.
  - `name`: The name of the product.
  - `description`: Product description.
  - `price`: Price of the product.
  - `stock`: The number of items available.
  - **Why necessary**: You need a product catalog to allow users to select items, and their prices will be used to calculate the total order amount.

#### SQL:
```sql
create table products (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  name text not null,
  description text,
  price numeric not null,
  stock integer not null,
  image_url text,
  alt_image text
);
```

---

### 6. **Table: `order_items` (Order Product Details)**
- **Purpose**: Associate multiple products with an order and track the quantity of each product in the order.
- **Fields**:
  - `id`: Primary key, unique identifier for each item in an order.
  - `order_id`: Foreign key referencing the related order (from `orders.id`).
  - `product_id`: Foreign key referencing the product (from `products.id`).
  - `quantity`: Number of units of the product in the order.
  - `price`: The price of the product at the time of the order.
  - **Why necessary**: A single order can include multiple products, and this table allows you to track the details of what was purchased.

#### SQL:
```sql
create table order_items (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  order_id bigint references orders(id),
  product_id bigint references products(id),
  quantity integer not null,
  price numeric not null
);
```
